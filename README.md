A police department has set speed traps to catch people speeding around town. They set up traps that have long ropelike road switches that go across the roadway. Like this.

The department has the equipment but they are missing the code. Specifically they need the function that can calculate the speed. Write a function called calculateSpeed() that takes two parameters in this order.
distance which is the distance between the two road switches in feet 
time which is the amount of seconds that have passed between when the first road switch was run over and the second

 This function needs to return the speed in miles per hour.
